# Usage
1) You need the NRRD Format File Reader from 
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34653-nrrd-format-file-reader/content/nrrdread.m
copy this file into this folder.

2) Open the run_matalb.m script. The comments are 
self-explanatory. It downloads gene-expression
data and connectivity from the Allen Brain Atlas API

3) Open the predict_brain_networks.R script. It works with
the data that has been generated in step 2. The script was 
tested on a Ubuntu 14.04 linux machine with 250GB Ram and 
20 cores with R 3.2.3. Some packages will not run with a 
version prior 3.2.

File overview:
